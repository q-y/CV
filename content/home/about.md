# Biography

I have a wide range of interests in wireless communications and signal processing in the physical layer. 
Most of my current research focuses on **backscatter wireless communications, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems, and physical layer security**.
The mathematical tools utilized in my current research are mainly convex and nonconvex optimization, probability theory, and stochastic geometry.

In addition, I serve as a reviewer for IEEE Wireless Communications Magazine, IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, IEEE Communications Letters, and IEEE Access.
