**National High-tech R\&D Program of China (863 Program)**, **Research Experience**, Sep. 2015 — Jan. 2016, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China\\
_Mission:_ Research on future-oriented physical-layer wireless access and secure communication technologies. My main work in this program involves

- Relevant literature review at the early stage of the program. 
- Designed a scheme for secret key agreement based on the preset pilot in physical layer. 
- Set up the needed Matlab simulation environment based on the spatial channel model extension (SCME). 



**Undergraduate Research Training and Practice Innovation Fund**, **Hardware Practice Program**, Jun. 2012 — Jun. 2013, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China\\
_Target:_ Development of an energy-saving lamp controller for classrooms or factories based on body localization.

- The scene images can be captured using the pre-existing camera in the classroom or factory. A testbed is developed where the OV7670 camera chip is adopted for a proof-of-principle.  
- Designed image processing and body localization algorithms, and wrote the program logic of the lamp controller.
- Implemented the algorithms on the STM32F103RBT6 singlechip loaded on the testbed.



**National College Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program**, **Software Practice Program**, Jun. 2012 — Jun. 2013, Shaanxi Wisdeem Tech. Co., Ltd. \& Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China\\
_Target:_ Development of a learning resource sharing platform named “Cloud Education”.

- Designed the platform based on the Discuz! forum. The corresponding programs of web and mobile versions are implemented by the PHP and Android computer languages, respectively.
- Functions like download/upload files, user and credit managements are implemented.



**Ministry of Education Key Lab for Intelligent Networks and Network Security**, **Summer Internship**, Jul. 2011 — Aug. 2011, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China\\
_Mission:_ Research on the dynamic behavior analysis of malicious codes in the host computer.

- Classified the existing 1,188 samples of malicious codes according to their run-time behaviors. 
- Developed a sandbox system based on VMware to automatically analyze the behavior of any given program. 
- Established an independent website as the front end to show the structured report of the analysis. 



**In addition, I have attended the following flagship conferences held by the IEEE Communications Society**:

- 2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC), 21-25 May 2017, Paris, France.
- 2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM), 4-8 Dec. 2016, Washington, DC, USA.
- 2016 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC), 23-28 May 2016, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
